# SO_LONG

### [MILESTONE 2]
### SUMMARY
In this repository you can find the code implementation for the SO_LONG project for 42. The goal of the project is to create a simple yet engaging game using the MinilibX graphics library. The player navigates a character through a map, collecting items and reaching the exit to win the game.

This project demonstrates skills in C programming, graphics programming, memory management, and algorithm design (e.g., pathfinding).

### REPOSITORY STRUCTURE
- `src`: Contains the source code for the program.
- `includes`: Contains the header file `so_long.h`, `libft`, which is a custom library for utility functions, and the graphics library `minilibx`.
- `Makefile`: Compiles the project.
